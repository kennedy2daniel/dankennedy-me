This year has been pretty busy for me. Besides the projects at my government job, my small business has had an interesting year as well.</p> <p>Web development continues to amaze me by how quickly it changes. While core concepts remain the same, other technologies develop so rapidly it is a challenge to stay on top of it all. This year I developed in Python using the Django and Flask frameworks. I came to really enjoy Flask. I also developed a healthy respect for ASP.NET Core; sometimes Microsoft does get it right.</p><p>I can honestly say that I am looking forward what 2023 has to bring my way, and to the world of web development in general.</p>"
